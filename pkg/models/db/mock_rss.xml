                <![CDATA[
<p><em>Cape Town, 14 July 2025</em> – Black Sash notes the briefing delivered by SASSA CEO Themba Matlou this morning on the agency’s ongoing review process of social grant beneficiaries and the suspension of payments to thousands of individuals. While we appreciate the attempt to explain the legal framework and rationale behind the reviews, the reality for grant recipients on the ground tells a far more troubling story, one that cannot be brushed aside by semantics, administrative language or internal justifications.</p><p>We acknowledge that SASSA has a legal obligation to ensure the integrity of the social assistance system and conduct reviews as prescribed by the Social Assistance Act. However, this does not absolve the agency from its constitutional duty to ensure procedural fairness, transparency, and dignity in how these reviews are carried out.</p><p><a></a>Despite the CEO’s claim that no grants have been suspended, we are witnessing a surge in complaints from beneficiaries who have been cut off without clear explanation or notification. Our Community Monitoring teams, based across the country and our national Helpline have been overwhelmed with distress calls from elderly persons, people with disabilities and caregivers, many of whom only discovered their grants had been “flagged” when their money failed to appear. This was further exacerbated by the impact of bank verification checks on Older Persons’ grants, which also impacted grant payment delays and added to the fear, confusion, and queues at SASSA local offices.</p><p>We reject the notion that SMSs and bulk communication are sufficient or effective. Many grant beneficiaries, particularly in rural and peri-urban communities have limited access to phones, network connectivity, digital platforms, or updated contact details which SASSA themselves note.</p><p>Black Sash has consistently called SASSA out on its poor communication strategy and bulk communication in a short time does not address the issue of beneficiaries not receiving their grants within a reasonable time in a way that SASSA can constitute adequate notice confirming that the beneficiary has been informed. It is the state’s duty to provide reliable, direct and accessible communication and not to shift the blame onto those who are most excluded from formal systems.</p><p>What SASSA’s Briefing Did Not Address:</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li>Where is the evidence of proper notice, as required under administrative justice provisions? </li><li>Does SASSA have the necessary capacity to deal with influx of beneficiaries flagged for review, as we see queues of people growing at local offices with many being turned away, without being assisted?</li><li>Why was the rollout of a 4th payment date not accompanied by public education or accessible notice to affected communities?</li><li>Have SASSA staff been briefed on these processes and adequately trained to respond in a way that is supportive?</li><li>What mechanisms are in place for appeals or immediate reinstatement for those wrongly flagged?</li></ol><p>We also find the justification of “National Treasury conditions” deeply concerning. If fiscal austerity is driving the removal of people from the social grant system under the guise of fraud detection &#8211; this represents a direct threat to the constitutional rights of the poor and vulnerable. Fiscal accountability cannot come at the expense of people&#8217;s basic needs and dignity.</p><p><a></a>Black Sash does not oppose fair and lawful grant reviews. But a review process that results in confusion, exclusion and hunger without due process is not a review.</p><p>We call on SASSA and the Department of Social Development to:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Pause further reviews until effective, community-based communication strategies are in place.</li><li>Ensure that SASSA staff have been trained and have the requisite capacity to implement the review process at its local offices,</li><li>Publish clear criteria for review selection and provide beneficiaries with accessible avenues to challenge decisions.Ensure that the affected beneficiary has received reasonable notice</li><li>Commit to working with civil society and grassroots organisations to improve outreach and support mechanisms.</li></ul><p>Social grants are not just a bureaucratic process, they are a lifeline, a constitutional right and a matter of life and dignity for millions. We urge SASSA to act swiftly and justly.</p><p><strong>For media enquiries and interviews, contact Oliver Meth, Communications &amp; Media Manager on 068 352 9045 or email </strong><a href="mailto:oliver@blacksash.org.za"><strong>oliver@blacksash.org.za</strong></a></p><p>The post <a href="https://www.blacksash.org.za/black-sash-responds-to-sassa-ceo-media-briefing-on-grant-suspensions/">Black Sash Responds to SASSA CEO Media Briefing on Grant Suspensions</a> appeared first on<a href="https://www.blacksash.org.za">Black Sash</a>.</p>

<p>Cape Town, South Africa, 05 May 2025 &#8211; Black Sash notes the <a href="https://www.citizen.co.za/news/south-africa/sassa-srd-grant-converted-basic-income-grant-mbalula/">recent public statement by ANC Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula</a> made during a visit to Freedom Park in Soweto, yesterday, regarding the conversion of the Social Relief of Distress (SRD) grant into a Basic Income Grant (BIG). We welcome the reaffirmation of the GNU’s commitment to ensuring long-term income support for those living in poverty and unemployed.</p><p>Since its inception in 2020, the SRD grant has served as a lifeline for millions, including South Africans, refugees and asylum seekers. For nearly 13 million people, this modest income support has helped meet basic needs in the absence of work opportunities or access to other forms of social protection. The recognition by the ANC of the need to institutionalise and expand this support is a critical step in the right direction.</p><p>However, Black Sash cautions that the transition to a Basic Income Grant must be grounded in constitutional principles of equality, dignity and access to social protection for all. A meaningful BIG must not simply be a repackaged or a renamed SRD grant — it must be universal, accessible and adequate to meet people’s basic needs. The current SRD grant amount, even with the recent increase to R370, falls far below the food poverty line and is insufficient to restore dignity or break the cycle of poverty.</p><p>We call on government to:</p><ol class="wp-block-list"><li>Urgently publish a clear, inclusive roadmap with clear timelines for the introduction of a permanent Basic Income Grant;</li><li>Address the systemic and administrative challenges with the SRD Grant to remedy unfair disqualifications due to flawed verification systems to ensure access to the grant and ensure transparent and inclusive transformation to universal basic income;</li><li>Raise the grant value to at least be in line with the upper-bound poverty line with increases to have a decent standard of living with dignity;</li><li>Secure sustainable and progressive financing for BIG that does not compromise other social spending commitments.</li></ol><p>We also note with concern the ongoing issues and delays in SRD payments and urge SASSA and Treasury to improve administrative efficiency and transparency, especially around verification processes, so that recipients do not suffer unnecessary hardship.</p><p>Black Sash stands ready to engage with policymakers and civil society to ensure that the Basic Income Grant becomes a transformative tool for building a more just, equitable society — one where everyone has the means to live in dignity.</p><p><em>For media enquiries, contact Black Sash Communications &amp; Media Manager, Oliver Meth on 068 352 9045 or email </em><a href="mailto:oliver@blacksash.org.za"><em>oliver@blacksash.org.za</em></a><em></em></p><p></p><p>The post <a href="https://www.blacksash.org.za/black-sash-responds-to-anc-statement-on-conversion-of-srd-grant-into-basic-income-grant/">Black Sash Responds to ANC Statement on Conversion of SRD Grant into Basic Income Grant</a> appeared first on<a href="https://www.blacksash.org.za">Black Sash</a>.</p>

The ongoing issues of non-payment, inaccessible replacement sites, post office closures, and limited home visits demand urgent intervention. We call for the immediate resolution of payment failures for those who have already swapped their cards, as well as a major expansion of mobile replacement services to reach rural and underserved areas. A clear contingency plan must be put in place for beneficiaries who no longer have a nearby post office, ensuring they can still access their grants. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="auto">Additionally, post offices must be adequately resourced with staff, payment facility (system that enables post office staff to make payment) and sufficient cash reserves to handle the surge in demand after the deadline. Home visit services must also be significantly increased to support beneficiaries who are unable to travel to replacement sites. Lastly, the USSD system must be updated in real time to ensure beneficiaries receive accurate information on where they can access their grants. Failure to act swiftly will leave thousands without the financial lifeline they depend on, deepening poverty and distress among the most vulnerable in our society.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="auto">We strongly urge Postbank and SASSA to extend their outreach efforts and increase the availability of replacement sites. The current list of sites primarily in larger retailers may not be accessible to all beneficiaries. We recommend expanding mobile or pop-up services in areas with high concentrations of elderly or mobility-impaired beneficiaries.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="auto">It is reassuring that Postbank and SASSA have assured beneficiaries that any remaining funds in SASSA gold cards will be safely stored in their Postbank accounts and will be accessible through other withdrawal methods, such as Post Offices or retailer cardless payments. However, t</span><span data-contrast="auto">he nationwide closure of post offices has </span><span data-contrast="auto">created significant barriers to grant access, particularly for the over 1 million beneficiaries who may now rely on these locations for withdrawals after the 20 March 2025 deadline. With fewer operational post offices, many beneficiaries face longer travel distances, higher transport costs, and overcrowding at remaining branches, making it even harder to access their grants. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="auto">Additionally, there are growing concerns about whether these post offices will have sufficient cash reserves to accommodate the increased demand. Without proper planning, hundreds of thousands of beneficiaries could be left without access to their grants due to cash shortages or limited-service points. Black Sash urges Postbank and SASSA to ensure that all remaining post offices are adequately resourced, both in terms of staff capacity and cash flow, to prevent disruptions and delays in payments.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="auto">Furthermore, while we understand that the Postbank black card will continue to be issued after March 20, we emphasize the urgency of ensuring a smooth transition before the next scheduled grant payment period in April 2025. Beneficiaries who have not received their new cards by April 2025 should not face additional barriers to accessing their funds.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="auto">We welcome the introduction of home visit arrangements for bedridden and incapacitated beneficiaries. This service is crucial for those who are unable to travel to card replacement sites. However, we are concerned that the eligibility criteria for home visits may be too restrictive and may leave out individuals who are also facing hardships but do not fit the listed criteria. Black Sash calls for greater flexibility in ensuring that home visits are available to anyone who is unable to access a card replacement site due to illness or physical disability.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="auto">Additionally, we strongly advise Postbank and SASSA to simplify the process for beneficiaries seeking home visits, ensuring that there are no additional administrative burdens or fines for families trying to secure this support for their loved ones.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="auto">Considering the potential confusion among beneficiaries, </span><span data-contrast="auto">Black Sash </span><span data-contrast="auto">would like to emphasize the importance of </span><span data-contrast="auto">clear communication</span><span data-contrast="auto">. It is critical that beneficiaries understand the entire process — from card replacement to how they can access their funds after the gold cards are deactivated. While we appreciate the measures in place to safeguard grant payments, we remain deeply concerned about beneficiaries who may be misled by opportunistic individuals attempting to trick them into changing their banking arrangements. It is imperative that Postbank and SASSA continue to communicate loudly and clearly that </span><span data-contrast="auto">only Postbank</span><span data-contrast="auto"> is responsible for replacing SASSA gold cards with black cards.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="auto">We also urge the </span><span data-contrast="auto">Postbank and SASSA</span><span data-contrast="auto"> to consider stronger consumer protection measures to safeguard beneficiaries from fraud and exploitation by unscrupulous third parties.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="auto">At </span><span data-contrast="auto">Black Sash</span><span data-contrast="auto">, we continue to call for a </span><span data-contrast="auto">Basic Income Support Grant</span><span data-contrast="auto">as a long-term solution to poverty alleviation in South Africa. The replacement of SASSA gold cards with Postbank black cards should not be seen as the only step in ensuring that our country’s most vulnerable citizens receive the social protection they deserve.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="auto">As we move forward, it is crucial that South Africa’s fiscal and social protection systems focus on investing in people, ensuring transparent systems, and providing sustainable financial safety nets. Social grant beneficiaries, particularly those who depend on these funds for basic survival, should never be left behind in the race for economic progress. We must continue to focus on improving service delivery and ensuring that all citizens, especially the poor and marginalized, have access to the social protection floor that is their right.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240}"> </span></p><p><span data-contrast="auto">In conclusion, while we acknowledge the progress made in replacing SASSA gold cards, </span><span data-contrast="auto">Black Sash </span><span data-contrast="auto">urges </span><span data-contrast="auto">Postbank and SASSA</span><span data-contrast="auto"> to ensure that all beneficiaries, especially those most vulnerable, are not left behind.

        <![CDATA[<p><strong><em>Cape Town, South Africa</em> [12 March 2025]</strong> – In response to Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana’s 2025 Budget Speech, we express concern that despite a second chance at the Budget Speech, the Minister yet again failed to prioritise investment in the majority of those residing in South Africa.</p><p>While it would be expected that we should be grateful for the social grant increases, and the extension of the Social Relief of Distress (SRD) Grant, it begs the question whether it is enough of a buffer to counter the VAT increase of 0.5% increase which disproportionality affects the poor.</p><p>Grants serve as a vital lifeline for millions of South Africans facing economic hardship. While we note the increases of grants above the inflation rate, it is important to highlight that the Child Support Grant continues to be below the Food Poverty Line of R796 and the value of the SRD Grant has not been increased, with a limited budget allocation which does not speak to the reality of the unemployment crisis in South Africa.&nbsp; This is deeply concerning, as it means that recipients of these grants are still unable to meet their most basic nutritional needs, exacerbating food insecurity and poverty.</p><p>The VAT increase signals a troubling backtrack on the government&#8217;s social contract with its people, particularly given the already high cost of living. We believe that the Minister has run out of ideas on how to generate the necessary revenue for national development, and resorting to a VAT hike is a short-sighted solution that will only exacerbate inequality and hardship for millions of South Africans.</p><p>We categorically do not support any form of VAT increase, as it places an unfair burden on those who are already struggling to make ends meet. Instead, we urge the Minister and members of the GNU to explore alternative, progressive tax reforms that target wealthier individuals and corporations, who have the capacity to contribute more to the country’s fiscal needs.</p><p>This budget is a case in point following a strategic engagement hosted by Black Sash with the National Planning Commission and the International Labour Organisation where we amplified that the South African government must recognise its constitutional obligations and international commitments to provide a basket of services for a decent standard of living with dignity. Instead of fiscal consolidation, the Minister of Finance must consider social spending on social services and providing income security as an investment which will ultimately lead to economic growth and alleviate poverty.</p><p>We call on Finance Minister Godongwana to reconsider this regressive tax increase and to commit to a more equitable and inclusive approach to revenue generation, which includes meaningful job creation initiatives, providing sustainable livelihoods for millions of South Africans/those residing in South Africa. Additionally, we demand clarity on the future of the SRD grant and reaffirm our call for the introduction of a Basic Income Support Grant as part of a broader commitment to social and economic justice.</p><p><strong><em>For further information or inquiries, please contact Oliver Meth, National Communications &amp; Media Manager on 068 352 9045 or email </em></strong><a href="mailto:oliver@blacksash.org.za"><strong><em>oliver@blacksash.org.za</em></strong></a><strong><em></em></strong></p><p><em>Issued by: Black Sash</em></p><p>The post <a href="https://www.blacksash.org.za/black-sash-reaction-to-finance-minister-enoch-godongwanas-2025-budget-speech/">Black Sash Reaction to Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana’s 2025 Budget Speech</a> appeared first on<a href="https://www.blacksash.org.za">Black Sash</a>.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p><strong>Johannesburg, South Africa – [10 March 2025]</strong> – Black Sash, in partnership with the National Planning Commission (NPC) and the International Labour Organization (ILO), is proud to announce an important two-day convening focused on advancing the Social Protection Floor (SPF) in South Africa. The event kicks off today in Boksburg, Gauteng and brings together key stakeholders, including policymakers, civil society organizations, trade unionists, academics, and social protection experts, to engage in dialogue and action aimed at strengthening the country&#8217;s social protection framework.</p><p>The National Development Plan in 2012 proposed that South Africa should work towards a definition of the social protection floor (SPF). A SPF is a comprehensive, rights-based framework aimed at ensuring that all individuals enjoy access to essential services and income for all people. A SPF includes elements such as healthcare including maternity care; basic income security for children providing access to nutrition, education, care and necessary goods and services, basic income security for persons of active age who are unable to earn sufficient income and basic income security for older persons and persons with disabilities. These guarantees should enable access to key services such education and housing, contributing to reducing poverty and inequality.</p><p>This convening will provide a platform for broadening understanding and building a consensus on different elements of the SPF. South has many of the elements in place, such as income support for children, elderly and persons with disabilities, however this support is targeted and not universal. The participants will also discuss strategies to implement and expand the SPF, ensuring that all persons living in South Africa are covered by basic social protection systems.</p><p><strong>Key highlights of the convening include:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Panel Discussions and Presentations:</strong> Leading experts will explore the role of the Social Protection Floor in achieving the development goals of the NDP and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with a focus on inclusive social policies that address current gaps.</li><li><strong>Workshops and Breakout Sessions:</strong> Interactive sessions designed to promote collaborative discussions on the technical and operational aspects of social protection policies considering basic income, basic services, education, health and nutrition as the foundational elements to start defining a social protection floor, including best practices and challenges faced in implementation.</li><li><strong>Stakeholder Engagement:</strong> The event will provide opportunities for networking and engaging with diverse sectors, including government officials, international organizations, and civil society representatives to work as a collective towards defining Social Protection Floor so that all in South Africa can live with dignity</li></ul><p>“The Social Protection Floor is essential to reducing vulnerability and promoting dignity for all South Africans,” said Rachel Bukasa, Executive Director of Black Sash. “This convening is an opportunity to bring together diverse voices and expertise to create meaningful change and contribute to a more equitable future.”</p><p>Bukasa added that through this partnership with the NPC and ILO, “we hope to foster constructive dialogue that leads to actionable steps towards realizing the SPF for all living in South Africa.”</p><p>Alexio Musindo, Director ILO Decent Work Technical Support Team for Eastern and Southern Africa emphasized the need for implementing Recommendations on Social Protection Floors adopted by ILO Member States in 2012 and ratifying ILO Conventions related to social protection, particularly Convention No.102 on Social Security is crucial to strengthening commitments and ensuring accountability.</p><p>“These instruments provide a clear framework for designing and implementing comprehensive social protection systems that align with international labour standards,” added Musindo.</p><p>The speaker from the National Planning Commission, Commissioner Phakama Ntshongwana will highlight government priorities and the importance of a coordinated approach to social protection in achieving the national development goals.</p><p><em>___ENDS____</em></p><p><strong>About Black Sash:</strong> Black Sash is a human rights organization committed to advancing social justice in South Africa.

        <![CDATA[<p><strong>MEDIA STATEMENT, Cape Town, 19 February 2025</strong> – Black Sash is deeply appalled by the political wrangling within the Government of National Unity (GNU) that has led to the shocking cancellation of the much-anticipated Budget Speech that was scheduled for today. This display of recklessness threatens the livelihoods of millions of South Africans who depend on social protection to survive.</p><p>“The absence of this critical address leaves significant uncertainty regarding the allocation of resources to essential social assistance programs. &#8220;While Black Sash supports the refusal of VAT increases, we disagree with the 11th hour nature of the cancellation,” said Executive Director Rachel Bukasa.<br />The Budget Speech is not a mere formality &#8211; it is a lifeline for the poor, unemployed, elderly and children who rely on social grants. Any delay or uncertainty in allocations risks serious consequences, including food insecurity, deepened poverty, and the erosion of public trust in government institutions. The inability of the GNU to put aside their inability to reach a just consensus and prioritise the needs of the most vulnerable is an unforgivable failure of leadership.</p><p>We believe that this abrupt cancellation raises serious concerns about transparency, accountability and the government&#8217;s commitment to addressing poverty and inequality.</p><p>As, Black Sash we demand urgent clarity from the Finance Minister and President Cyril Ramaphosa on immediate plans for social grants funding, including the extension Ramaphosa announced during his SONA on the SRD grants.</p><p>Black Sash calls on the Minister of Finance to urgently provide clarity on the rescheduling of the Budget Speech and to ensure that social protection remains a top priority, as South Africa is facing a growing cost-of-living crisis and vulnerable communities cannot afford delays in policy commitments and financial support.</p><p>We cannot be held to ransom for their political infighting while dignity and survival hang in the balance. We will not stand by while the government&#8217;s social contract with the people is shattered.</p><p>ISSUED BY BLACK SASH<br />For media enquiries and interviews, contact Oliver Meth on <a href="tel:+27683529045">068 352 9045</a> or email<a href="mailto:oliver@blacksash.org.za">oliver@blacksash.org.za</a></p><figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"></figure><p>The post <a href="https://www.blacksash.org.za/black-sash-appalled-by-budgetspeech-cancelation-and-gnu-infighting-at-the-expense-of-social-protection/">Black Sash appalled by #BudgetSpeech cancellation and GNU infighting at the expense of social protection</a> appeared first on<a href="https://www.blacksash.org.za">Black Sash</a>.</p>

    <![CDATA[<p><strong>MEDIA STATEMENT, Cape Town – 18 February 2025</strong> &#8211; In anticipation of Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana’s 2025 Budget Speech this Wednesday 19 February, Black Sash calls for the urgent need for the government to prioritize the welfare of those living in poverty in South Africa.</p><p>President Cyril Ramaphosa’s State of the Nation Address (SONA) was notably vague when addressing the future of social grants and the implementation of the Basic Income Grant (BIG). While he acknowledged the importance of social support for millions of vulnerable South Africans – his vagueness raises concerns, especially given the rising cost of living and the growing demand for financial relief among unemployed and low-income citizens.</p><p>As Black Sash, we recognize the importance of social grants in reducing poverty and inequality, and we are disappointed by the lack of a clear roadmap in SONA. The uncertainty surrounding the implementation of the BIG leaves many South Africans anxious about their economic future. The government has repeatedly acknowledged the need for social protection, yet there is still no definitive policy framework outlining how BIG will be funded and distributed. Without a firm commitment, millions who rely on social grants remain in limbo, unsure if the government will prioritize their well-being.</p><p>We now look to the upcoming Budget Speech, where we expect Finance Minister to provide the clarity and commitment that was missing from the President’s address. The budget must allocate sufficient resources to fulfill Ramaphosa’s government’s promises regarding social security. We urge the government to move beyond rhetoric and take meaningful steps toward implementing the Basic Income Grant. A concrete plan with clear funding strategies, implementation timelines, and long-term sustainability measures must be presented. The well-being of millions of those living in South Africa depends on decisive action, and we will continue to advocate for policies that prioritize economic justice and dignity for all.</p><p>Reflecting on our response to the 2024 budget, we advocate for the following key actions:</p><p><strong>1. Increase All Social Grants in Line with Inflation</strong>: To ensure that vulnerable individuals can maintain their purchasing power amidst rising costs, it&#8217;s essential that all social grants receive adjustments that match the current annual inflation rate.</p><p><strong>2. Establish a Permanent Social Relief of Distress (SRD) Grant</strong>: We call for the SRD grant to be made permanent and increase the amount to at least the Lower Bound Food Poverty Line, providing consistent support to unemployed individuals aged 18 to 59 who currently lack any form of income assistance.</p><p><strong>3. Raise the Child Support Grant to Meet the Food Poverty Line</strong>: The Child Support Grant should be increased to at least R760.00, aligning it with the Food Poverty Line to ensure that caregivers can adequately provide for the nutritional needs of children. This grant of R530 is the only permanent grant which is way below the Food Poverty Line. Carers struggle to properly provide for their children and have to find ways to provide for their children because the CSG is not enough. Many are vulnerable to reckless lending practices which puts them in a vicious cycle of debt.</p><p><strong>4. Enhance the Grant Payment System</strong>: We urge the development of a well-administered, transparent, efficient, and effective grant payment system managed by the South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) to ensure timely and accurate disbursements to beneficiaries. Beneficiaries are in a panic with the current issue of the imminent expiry of SASSA Gold Card because they fear that they are at risk of not receiving their grants. The roll out of the Postbank Black card to replace the SASSA card has been plagued with problems such as: a lack of sites and capacity to support the rollout and limited communication to keep beneficiaries abreast of developments.</p><p>Social assistance is an essential part of the basket of goods that must be supported by adequate public services so that people living in South Africa can live with dignity. Additionally, we call on National Treasury to provide funding for the implementation of a Social Protection Floor, which provides a minimum basket of essential goods and services that everyone in South Africa needs to survive. This is line with the National Development Plan which aims to ensure the achievement of a “<em>decent standard of living</em>” for all South Africans by 2030.</p><p>Black Sash remains committed to advocating for social justice and the protection of human rights. We believe that these proposed measures are crucial steps towards alleviating poverty and promoting economic stability in South Africa.</p><p>For media enquiries and interviews, contact Oliver Meth on <a href="tel:+27683529045">068 352 9045</a> or email<a href="mailto:oliver@blacksash.org.za">oliver@blacksash.org.za</a></p><figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-3 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"></figure><p>The post <a href="https://www.blacksash.org.za/black-sash-calls-on-finance-minister-to-raise-the-social-protection-floor-ahead-of-his-2025-budget-speech/">Black Sash calls on Finance Minister to raise the Social Protection Floor ahead of his 2025 Budget Speech</a> appeared first on<a href="https://www.blacksash.org.za">Black Sash</a>.</p>
